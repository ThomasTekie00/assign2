Imishli () is a rayon of Azerbaijan. Imishli and neighbouring Sabirabad rayon share Sarysu, the largest lake in Azerbaijan. In August 1930, Qaradonlu was organised on Mil-Mugan historical fields as a region. Earlier, during the Tsardom of Russia, Qaradonlu belonged to the Javad Khan administration. The Qaradonlu region is situated in a favourable area near the Aras River providing water resources, productive land and caravan roads. As early as the October Revolution, land-reclamation and irrigation work were made based on the intense irrigated plant-growing. In 1906, the first School of Qaradonlu region was established, with many living-buildings, caravanserais, mills and shops in the area. In 1933, Qaradonlu Machine-Tractor Plant was built in the Qaradonlu historical region. As a result of the construction of the railway between @l@t and Yerevan, people moved from the center of region to suburbs of the railway stations. The population increase motivated two-story brick buildings to be built among the Qaradonlu and Imishli villages, so the capital of the region was moved to here and the region was considered Imishli Rayon. Imishli village was rapidly expanded, much like the capital of the region. Government houses were constructed, completely transforming the overall appearance of the village. In 1944, Imishli was awarded status of town-type settlement, which progressed to city status in the 1960s. In 1959, on the Aras River in the B@hramt@p@ area, water storage was used - which was unique to that time period. The Bash Mugam and Azizbaiov irrigation canals provided water not only to the land area of Imishli, but also to land areas of Bilasuvar District and Saatly District. ==Populated Places== {| border="1" class="wikitable sortable" |+ Populated places in Imishli Rayon |- !
