Fiachu Labhrainne, son of Smirgoll, son of Enboth, son of Tigernmas, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He came to power by killing the previous incumbent, Eochaid Faebar Glas, in the battle of Carman, in vengeance for his father, who had been killed by Eochaid in the battle of Druimm Liathain. He was named after the river Labrainn, which burst from the ground during his reign. He fought a sea battle against the descendants of Eber Finn, and fought a battle against the Erainn at Mag Genainn in County Fermanagh, which resulted in Loch Erne bursting from the ground. In another battle he killed Eochaid's son Mofebis. Mofebis's son Eochu Mumu killed him in vengeance in the battle of Sliab Belgatain.R. A.
