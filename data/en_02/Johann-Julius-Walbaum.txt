Johann Julius Walbaum (30 June 1724, Wolfenbuttel, Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel - 21 August 1799, Lubeck) was a German physician, naturalist and fauna taxonomist. ==Works== As an ichthyologist, he was the first to describe many previously unknown fish species from remote parts of the globe, such as the Great Barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), the Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) from the Kamchatka River in Siberia, and the curimata-pacu (Prochilodus marggravii) from the Sao Francisco River in Brazil. He was also the first to observe gloves as a preventative against infection in medical surgery. In 1758, the gloves he observed were made from the cecum of the sheep, rather than rubber, which had not yet been discovered. ==Legacy== The Naturhistorische Museum in Lubeck, opened in 1893, was based on Walbaum's extensive scientific collection, which was lost during the Second World War. ==See also== * ==References== Category:German naturalists Category:German taxonomists 01 Category:1724 births Category:1799 deaths Category:German ichthyologists Category:German zoologists Category:People from Wolfenbuttel Category:People from Brunswick-Luneburg Category:18th-century German physicians Category:18th- century German zoologists Category:18th-century German writers
