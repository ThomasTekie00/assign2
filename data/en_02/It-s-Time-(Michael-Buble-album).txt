It's Time is the fourth studio album by Canadian-Italian vocalist Michael Buble that was released in 2005. With arrangements by David Foster, the album contains cover versions of songs from traditional pop and contemporary pop: George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Stevie Wonder, and The Beatles. And it includes "Home", a song co-written by Buble. Despite some unfavorable reviews, the album was a commercial success, topping the charts in Canada, Italy, and Spain, while peaking in the top ten in eleven other countries. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it three-times platinum, for shipments of three million copies across the United States. In Australia, the album was certified five times Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales of 350,000 copies sold, and in Canada it was certified six times Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for sales of 600,000 copies. ==Singles== In the U.S., "Home" reached No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while topping the Adult Contemporary chart. It also reached the top forty on the Adult Pop Songs and Digital Songs charts. "Home" peaked at No. 35 in Australia, No. 31 in the UK, and No. 1 in ten countries. Buble credits the success of It's Time, which sold six million copies by 2011, to "Home." It was the most played song on Canadian radio in 2006. It's Time sold well in Japan, Italy, and Australia, and charted in the top ten singles in both the U.K. and U.S. charts. Buble said that during the recording of It's Time he "came into [his] own as a songwriter" and hearing his own song on the radio made him feel "like a true artist." He acknowledged that a downside to producing covers of well-loved songs is that people often compare them to the original; in writing his own song, he says, he found a sense of freedom. Buble feels that the song is distinct in comparison to the other songs on the album because of its "country-pop twang" and more-relatable lyrics. The song was written collaboratively with Amy Foster-Gillies, Nashville native and daughter of successful Canadian musician David Foster. In his 2011 autobiography, Onstage Offstage, Buble states that then-girlfriend Debbie Timuss was his inspiration for the song. Timuss sang backing vocals on "Home" and appeared in the music video, which was filmed in the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver, Canada. "Home" won the 2006 Juno Award for single of the year. A cover version was recorded by American country singer Blake Shelton. Shelton's version of Buble's song landed him top of the charts for R&R; Singles Chart and MediaBase Singles. Shelton was quoted in saying," I loved 'Home' the first time I heard it, and I really love it now," said Shelton. "I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought it was a country song. I've had the honor of performing "Home" with Michael Buble on a couple of occasions and can honestly say he is a really great guy, and I think as a writer he's probably pretty excited that it's reached number one, too." Buble attributes the song's popularity to its universal theme, stating that "[w]e all know what it's like to be homesick. It's one of the worst feelings. I know about that as well as anybody." "Home" was also featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 American romantic comedy The Wedding Date along with other songs from Buble's albums. ===Other singles=== "Feeling Good" was released as the first international single from the album on April 4, 2005. Although the single failed to chart in the United States, it managed to chart on the Austria Singles Chart at No. 66 and on the Dutch Singles Chart at No.61. It also charted in the United Kingdom, peaking at No. 69. ==Critical reception== The album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, with positive attention given to Buble's vocals. Aaron Latham of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars and felt that the album "mine[d] the rich history of pop music" as he noted that Buble applied "his own technique to classic standards and incorporate[d] his Rat Pack sound into modern pop songs". The songs "Home", "Can't Buy Me Love", "Song for You", and "You and I" were called the highlights of the album. Woodrow Wilkins from All About Jazz commended how It's Time was "relevant to today's audience" and noted that Buble "delivers [the songs] with the heart and passion that only a person who claims ownership of these titles can muster". However, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian didn't appreciate the album's composition of jazz and pop covers, saying that "Sinatra is turning in his grave". Amy Lichty of the Daily Emerald said that "Buble's clear voice and smooth rhythms keep the CD moving along", but also noted that he "is simply no match for either Sinatra or Connick" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Personnel adapted from AllMusic * Michael Buble - vocals * David Foster - keyboards * Chris Botti - trumpet * Gilbert Castellanos - trumpet * Sal Cracchiolo - trumpet * Kye Palmer - trumpet * George Bohanon - trombone * Ira Nepus - trombone * Bill Reichenbach Jr. - bass trombone * Jeff Clayton - alto saxophone * Keith Fiddmont - alto saxophone * Charles Owens - tenor saxophone * Rickey Woodard - tenor saxophone * Lee Callet - baritone saxophone * Dan Higgins - flute, saxophone * Alan Chang - piano * Tamir Hendelman - piano * Randy Waldman - piano * Jochem van der Saag - harmonica, organ * John Chiodini - guitar * Brian Green - guitar * Brandon Jenner - guitar * Dean Parks - guitar * Heitor Pereira - guitar * Michael Thompson - guitar * Anthony Wilson - guitar * Brian Bromberg - bass * Robert Hurst - bass * Christian McBride - bass * Vinnie Colaiuta - drums * Jeff Hamilton - drums * David Tull - drums * Rafael Padilla - percussion * Nelly Furtado - vocals * Debbie Timuss - background vocals Production * Sammy Nestico - orchestration * Arrangers - Jorge Calandrelli, John Clayon Jr., Jerry Hey, Bill Holman, Jeremy Lubbock, William Ross, Don Sebesky * David Foster - producer * Tommy LiPuma - producer * Humberto Gatica - producer, engineer, mixing * Vlado Meller - mastering * Mick Haggerty - art direction, design * Engineers - Al Schmitt, Alejandro Rodriguez, Christian Robles, Joe Wolhmuth, Jorge Vivo, Neil Devor, Steve Genewick, Andy Brohard, Bruce Monical, Wil Donovan ==Charts== ===Charts=== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
