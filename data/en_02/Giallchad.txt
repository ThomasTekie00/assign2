Giallchad, the son of Ailill Olchain, son of Sirna Saeglach, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, the 37th High King of Ireland. Giallchad took power after killing his predecessor, and the son of his grandfather's killer, Elim Olfinechta, in the battle of Comair Tri nUisce. He is said to have taken one out of every five men of Munster hostage. Giallchad reigned for nine years, before being killed by Elim's son Art Imlech at Mag Muaide. The Lebor Gabala Erenn synchronises his reign with that of Phraortes of the Medes (665-633 BC).R. A.
