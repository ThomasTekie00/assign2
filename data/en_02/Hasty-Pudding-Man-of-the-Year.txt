The Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award is bestowed annually by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals society at Harvard University. It has been awarded since 1967 to performers deemed by the society members to have made a "lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment." The Man of the Year recipient is traditionally invited to Harvard Square for various events in his honor before the opening night of the Hasty Pudding show. These include a tour of historic Harvard Yard with entertainment by the Radcliffe Pitches and culminate with a dinner and roast by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals members.
