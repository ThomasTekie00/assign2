Enna Derg, son of Dui Finn, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland, who took power after killing his predecessor, and his father's killer, Muiredach Bolgrach. He was called derg, red, because he had a red face. It is said that coins were first used in Ireland during his reign. He ruled for twelve years, before dying of plague in Sliab Mis, surrounded by a large number of his troops. He was succeeded by his son Lugaid Iardonn. The Lebor Gabala Erenn synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes I of Persia (465-424 BC).R. A.
