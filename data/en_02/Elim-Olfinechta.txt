Elim Olfinechta, son of Rothechtaid Rotha, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne after his father was struck by lightning. Snow that tasted of wine (Old Irish oll, "great, ample", fin, "wine", snechta, "snow")Dictionary of the Irish Language, Compact Edition, Royal Irish Academy, 1990, pp. 306, 489-490, 552 is said to have fallen in his reign. He ruled for only one year, before he was killed by Giallchad, grandson of Sirna Saeglach, the High King who had been overthrown by Elim's father. The Lebor Gabala Erenn synchronises his reign with that of Phraortes of the Medes (665-633 BC).R. A.
