{| |} Dupleix is a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Navy. She is the fourth French vessel (beside also two French commercial ships) named after the 18th century Governor of Pondichery and Governor-General of the French possessions in India marquess Joseph Francois Dupleix. Note: The French navy doesn't use the term "destroyer" for its ships; hence some large ships, referred to as "frigates", are registered as destroyers.
