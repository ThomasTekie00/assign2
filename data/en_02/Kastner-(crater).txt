Apollo 15 mapping camera image with high sun angle, showing degree of erosion of the rims Oblique view centered on Kastner from Apollo 12, facing northwest Oblique view from Apollo 14 Kastner is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon, to the southwest of the Mare Smythii. Just to the northwest of Kastner is the walled plain Gilbert. To the south is the prominent crater Ansgarius, and to the southwest lies La Perouse. This formation belongs to the category termed a walled plain. It has a worn, irregular outer wall that is overlaid by several small craters and there is a small break along the north-northeast. Along the northeastern rim is Kastner B, and to the southwest is the small Kastner E. A shallow, unnamed crater is attached to the southern rim. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with only a few small craterlets and minor ridges. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kastner. {| class="wikitable" !width="25%" style="background:#eeeeee;" |Kastner !width="25%" style="background:#eeeeee;" |Latitude !width="25%" style="background:#eeeeee;" |Longitude !width="25%" style="background:#eeeeee;" |Diameter |- |align="center"|A |align="center"|4.5deg S |align="center"|77.3deg E |align="center"|25 km |- |align="center"|B |align="center"|6.3deg S |align="center"|80.7deg E |align="center"|20 km |- |align="center"|C |align="center"|8.0deg S |align="center"|76.9deg E |align="center"|19 km |- |align="center"|E |align="center"|8.1deg S |align="center"|77.6deg E |align="center"|10 km |- |align="center"|G |align="center"|4.2deg S |align="center"|79.0deg E |align="center"|72 km |- |align="center"|R |align="center"|6.9deg S |align="center"|82.3deg E |align="center"|17 km |- |align="center"|S |align="center"|8.0deg S |align="center"|83.2deg E |align="center"|30 km |} The following craters have been renamed by the IAU. * Kastner F -- See Black.
