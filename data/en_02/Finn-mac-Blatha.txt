Finn, son of Blath, son of Labraid Condelg, son of Cairpre, son of Ollom Fotla, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He took power after he killed the previous High King, Eochu Apthach, whose disastrous year on the throne had been characterised by constant plague. He ruled for twenty, or twenty-two, or thirty years, depending on the source consulted, until he was killed by Setna Innarraid, son of Bres Ri. The Lebor Gabala Erenn synchronises his reign with that of Darius the Great of Persia (522-485 BC).R. A.
