Just Another Band from L.A. is a live album by The Mothers, released in 1972 (see 1972 in music). It was recorded live on August 7, 1971 in Pauley Pavilion on the campus of UCLA in Los Angeles. A notable inclusion on this album is "Billy the Mountain", Zappa's long, narrative parody of rock operas, which were gaining popularity at that time. Originally planned for release as a double LP with solos from "Studebaker Hoch" and "The Subcutaneous Peril" taking up most of the second LP in addition to parts of "Billy the Mountain" itself, and often overlooked by reviewers, this album marks an important period in the band's career which was soon ended by Zappa's severe injuries after being pushed off a stage. The song "Eddie, Are You Kidding?" refers to Edward Nalbandian, while "The Subcutaneous Peril", which ultimately became an outtake from the album, would later appear, in an edited form, on Finer Moments (2012) instead. The album was reissued on CD with badly flawed mastering and no composition credits by Rykodisc in 1990 and repackaged with the same audio but with the composition credits restored in 1995. In 2012 Universal/UMe issued a properly remastered edition on CD. ==Track listing== All songs written, composed and arranged by Frank Zappa except where noted. ==Personnel== * Frank Zappa - guitar, vocals * Don Preston - keyboards * Ian Underwood - woodwinds, keyboards, vocals * Aynsley Dunbar - drums * Howard Kaylan - lead vocals * Mark Volman - lead vocals * Jim Pons - bass guitar, vocals ==Charts== {| class="wikitable" !scope="col"|Chart (1972) !scope="col"|Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style="text-align:center;"|41 |- |Billboard 200 |align="center"|85 |} ==References== Category:1972 live albums Category:Albums produced by Frank Zappa Category:Frank Zappa live albums Category:Reprise Records live albums
