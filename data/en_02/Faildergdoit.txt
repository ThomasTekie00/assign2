Faildergdoit (later spelled Faildeargdoid or Ailldeargoid), son of Muinemon, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. He is said to have been the first king in Ireland whose subjects wore gold rings (Old Irish failge) on their hands. He ruled for ten years before being killed, either by Sirna mac Dein, or by his successor Ollom Fotla, whose father, Fiachu Finscothach, had been killed by Failderdoit's father Muinemon.R. A.
