Eochu (or Eochaid) Uairches, son of Lugaid Iardonn, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. After Lugaid was overthrown and killed by Sirlam, Eochu was driven into exile overseas, but he returned after twelve years, killed Sirlam with an arrow, and took the throne. His epithet is obscure: the Lebor Gabala Erenn says he gained it because of his exile,R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gabala Erenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 255-257 while Geoffrey Keating explains it as meaning "bare canoes", because he had canoes for a fleet, in which he and his followers used to plunder neighbouring countries.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Eirinn 1.27 He ruled for twelve years, before he was killed by Eochu Fiadmuine and Conaing Bececlach. The Lebor Gabala synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes I of Persia (465-424 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar Eirinn dates his reign to 633-621 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 856-844 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4344-4356 ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland
