Dui Ladrach, son of Fiachu Tolgrach, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He helped his father kill the High King Art mac Lugdach, then helped Airgetmar take the throne by killing Art's son Ailill Finn and grandson Eochu mac Ailella. Finally he and Eochu Fiadmuine's son Lugaid Laigdech killed Airgetmar, and Dui took the throne himself, ruling for ten years until his former accomplice Lugaid killed him. The Lebor Gabala synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes III of Persia (358-338 BC).R. A.
