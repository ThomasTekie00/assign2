Fiacha Finscothach, son of Setna Airt, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. His father became High King after killing the previous incumbent, Rothechtaid mac Main, in single combat at Cruachan in defence of Fiachu. Fiachu went into exile, but returned at the head of a "black fleet", and, with the assistance of Muinemon, killed his father and took the throne himself.
