Eochu (or Eochaid), son of Ailill Finn, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne after his father was killed by Airgetmar and his ally Dui Ladrach. According to the Lebor Gabala Erenn, he was himself killed by Airgetmar and Dui.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gabala Erenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 261 Geoffrey Keating says he ruled for seven years, resisted Airgetmar and made peace with Dui, who killed him treacherously at a meeting, allowing Airgetmar to take the kingship.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Eirinn 1.27 The Lebor Gabala synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes II of Persia (404-358 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar Eirinn dates his reign to 577-570 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 785-778 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4415-4422 ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland
