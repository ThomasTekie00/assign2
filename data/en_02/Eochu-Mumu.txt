Eochu Mumu (or Eochaid Mumo, Mumho), son of Mofebis, son of Eochaid Faebar Glas, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. According to the Lebor Gabala Erenn he came to power after killing the previous incumbent, Fiachu Labrainne, who had killed his father in battle. The province of Munster is named after him. He ruled for 21 years, fighting many battles against the descendants of Erimon, before he was killed by Fiachu's son Oengus Olmucaid in the battle of Cliu. He would later be avenged by his own son Enna Airgdech.R. A.
