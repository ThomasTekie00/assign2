Henry Casimir II of Nassau-Dietz (The Hague, 18 January 1657 - Leeuwarden, 25 March 1696) was Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen from 1664 till 1696. ==Life== Henry Casimir II of Nassau-Dietz was the eldest son of Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz and Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau, daughter of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel. When his father, a member of the branch of Nassau- Dietz, died in 1664, he was made stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen (under guardianship of his mother as he was then seven years old). In 1675, Friesland voted to make its stadtholdership hereditary in the house of Nassau-Dietz. Hendrik Casimir II was therefore the first Friesian stadtholder. In 1683, he married his cousin Henriette Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau, daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. Hendrik Casimir was succeeded as stadtholder by his son Johan Willem Friso of Orange-Nassau. == Issue == Henry Casimir II From his marriage, Henry Casimir II had the following children: * Willem George Friso (1685-1686), Hereditary Prince of Nassau-Dietz * Henriette Albertine (1686-1754), Princess of Nassau-Dietz * Johan Willem Friso (1687-1711), Stadholder in Friesland and Groningen * Maria Amalia (1689-1771) Princess of Nassau-Dietz * Sofia Hedwig (1690-1734), married in 1708 Duke Charles Leopold of Mecklenburg (1678-1747), son of Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow * Isabelle Charlotte (1692-1757), married in 1725 Prince Christian, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg (1688-1739), son of Henry, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg * Johanna Agnes (1693-1765), Princess of Nassau-Dietz * Louise Leopoldina (1695-1758), Princess of Nassau-Dietz * Henriette Casimira (1696-1738), Princess of Nassau-Dietz == Ancestors == ==External links== * |- |- Category:1657 births Category:1696 deaths Category:Dutch stadtholders Category:People from The Hague Category:Counts of Nassau
