Domzale (; )Leksikon obcin kraljestev in dezel zastopanih v drzavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906. Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Drzavna Tiskarna, p. 24. is a town and the seat of Municipality of Domzale. The town lies near the foothills of the Kamnik Alps and is crossed by the Kamnik Bistrica River. It includes the hamlets of Zgornje Domzale (; ), Spodnje Domzale (; ), and Studa. Domzale is known today for its small businesses, agriculture, and light industry. ==Name== Domzale was attested in written sources circa 1200-1230 as Domsselsdorf (and as Vnheilden dorf in 1260, Vnsselsdorf in 1302, Vnsersdorf in 1322, Dumsel in 1490, and Damschale in 1558, among other variations.) The medieval German name Unser(s)dorf is derived from (D)unselsdorf, which was presumably borrowed from the Slovene name and from which the initial D- was lost because it was reanalyzed as a definite article. The Slovene name could be reconstructed as *Domzale, based on a Slavic personal name such as *Domozal' and referring to an early inhabitant of the place. Alternatively, the Slovene name may be borrowed from Middle High German Domsell(sdorf), based in turn on a Slavic name such as *Domoslav'. In the local dialect, the town is referred to as Dumzale.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimoloski slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalozba ZRC, pp. 118-119. In the past the German name was Domschale. ==History== Domzale became a town in 1925 and a city on 19 April 1952. In the following years, Domzale became an industrial center with strong chemical and textile industry. In 1980, the construction of modern apartments began and Domzale became known as a bedroom community of Ljubljana. After Slovenia declared independence, on 27 June 1991 the Yugoslav army attacked barricades in the town, and bombed the radio transmitter and houses. ==Church== Assumption Church The church in Domzale is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It is surrounded by a cemetery and stands on a hill just north of the new municipal cemetery. ==Radio transmitter== The Domzale radio transmitter, the most powerful transmitter in Slovenia, is located near Domzale. It operates on medium wave frequency 918 kHz and can be received at night throughout Europe. It uses a 161 m guyed steel tube mast as an aerial. ==Sports== *Helios Suns *NK Domzale ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Domzale include: *Ivan Ahcin (1897-1960), sociologist and journalist *Franc Bernik (1870-1948), writer and composer *Danijel Fugger (born 1927), painter *Tine Hribar (born 1941), philosopher and public intellectual *Joze Karlovsek (1900-1963), architect and ethnologist *Vence Kozelj (1901-1968), electrical engineer *Peter Loboda (1894-1952), sculptor *Milan Merhar (1910-1988), painter *Matija Rode (1879-1961), journalist and librarian *Josip Sicherl (1860-1935), composer *Matija Tomc (1899-1986), composer *Marijan Vojska (born 1934), graphic artist *Breda Zorec (born 1941), storyteller *Radovan Trifunovic (born 1973), basketball coach *Dalibor Stevanovic (born 1984), football player *Teja Gregorin, biathlon ==Gallery== File:Domzale - Menacenkova domacija (Cankarjeva 9).jpg|The Menacenk House ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * Bernik, Franc.
