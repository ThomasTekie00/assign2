Faten Hamama ( ; 27 May 1931 - 17 January 2015) was an Egyptian film and television actress and film producer. She made her screen debut in 1939, when she was seven years old. Her earliest roles were minor, but her activity and gradual success helped to establish her as a distinguished Egyptian actress. Later revered as an icon in Egyptian and Middle Eastern cinema, Hamama substantially helped in improving the cinema industry in Egypt and emphasizing the importance of women in cinema and Egyptian society. After a seven-year hiatus from acting, Hamama returned in 2000 in what was a much anticipated television series, Wageh El Amar (wjh lqmr, Face of the Moon). In 2000, she was selected as Star of the Century by the Egyptian Writers and Critics organization. In 1996, nine of the films she starred in were included in the top 100 films in the history of Egyptian cinema by the cinema critics in Cairo. ==Early life and career== Faten Hamama was born in 1931Sharif, Omar (1977), The Eternal Matgjtttftyle: Mhhhy Own Sug5tory, Doubleday: New York, 1st edition, p. 69. to an Egyptian Muslim lower middle class family in Mansoura, Egypt (according to her birth certificate), but she claimed to have been born in the Abdin quarter of Cairo. She has an older brother, Monir, a younger sister, Layla and a younger brother, Mazhar. Her aspiration for acting arose at an early age. Hamama said that she was influenced by Assia Dagher as a child. When she was six years old, her father took her to the theater to see an Assia Dagher film; when the audience clapped for Assia, she told her father she felt they were clapping for her. Hamama in her first film, Yawm Said (1940). When she won a children's beauty pageant in Egypt, her father sent her picture to the director Mohammed Karim who was looking for a young female child to play the role of a small girl with the famous actor and musician Mohamed Abdel Wahab in the film Yawm Said (ywm s`yd, Happy Day, 1939). After an audition, Abdel Wahab decided she was the one he was looking for. After her role in the film, people called her "Egypt's own Shirley Temple". The director liked her acting and was impressed with her so much that he signed a contract with her father. Four years later, she was chosen by Kareem for another role with Abdel Wahab in the film Rossassa Fel Qalb (rSS@ fy lqlb, Bullet in the Heart, 1944) and in another film two years later, Dunya (dny, Universe, 1946). After her success, Hamama moved with her parents to Cairo and started her study at the High Institute of Acting in 1946. ==Career== Youssef Wahbi, an Egyptian actor and director, recognised the young actress's talent so he offered her a lead role in the 1946 film Malak al-Rahma (mlk lrHm@, Angel of Mercy). The film attracted widespread media attention, and Hamama, who was only 15 at the time, became famous for her melodramatic role. In 1949, Hamama had roles in three films with Wahbi: Kursi al-I`tiraf (krsy l`trf, Chair of Confession), Al-Yateematain (lytymtyn, The Two Orphans) and Sitt al-Bayt (st lbyt, Lady of the House). All were successful films.Darwish (1998) pp. 30-31 The 1950s were the beginning of the golden age of the Egyptian cinema industry, and Hamama played a significant part. In 1952 she starred in the film Lak Yawm Ya Zalem (lk ywm y Zlm, Your Day will Come) which was nominated at the Cannes Film Festival for the Prix International award. She also played lead roles in Yousef Shaheen's Baba Ameen (bb 'myn, Ameen, my Father, 1950) and Sira` Fi al-Wadi (Sr` fy lwdy, Struggle in the Valley, 1954) which was a strong nominee at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival for the Prix International award. Hamama is also known for having played the lead role in the first Egyptian mystery film Al-Manzel Raqam 13 (lmnzl rqm 13, House Number 13). In 1963, she received an award for her role in the political film La Waqt Lel Hob (l wqt llHb, No Time for Love). Hamama was also able to make it to Hollywood; in 1963 she had a role in the crime film, Cairo. In 1947, Hamama married actor/film director Ezzel Dine Zulficar while filming the Abu Zayd al-Hilali ('bw zyd lhlly) film. They started a production company which produced the film Maw`ed Ma` al-Hayat (mw`d m` lHy@, Date with Life) in which she starred. This film earned her the title of the "lady of the Arabic screen". She divorced Zulficar in 1954. One year later, she married Egyptian film star Omar Sharif. Meanwhile, Hamama continued to act in films directed by her first husband. Hamama and Omar Sharif in a scene from the 1957 film Ard al-Salam ("Land of Peace"). In 1954, while filming a Youssef Chahine film, Struggle in the Valley, Hamama refused to have the Egyptian actor Shukry Sarhan as a co-star, and Chahine offered Omar Sharif the role. Omar had just graduated from college then and was working for his father; Hamama accepted him as her co-star. Hamama had never agreed to act any scene involving a kiss in her career, but she accepted. They fell in love, and Sharif converted to Islam and married her. This marriage started a new era of Hamama's career, in which the couple made many films together. Sharif and Hamama were the romantic leads of Ayyamna al-Holwa ('ymn lHlw@, Our Sweet Days), Ard al-Salam ('rD lslm, Land of Peace), La Anam (l 'nm, Sleepless) and Sayyidat al-Qasr (syd@ lqSr, The Lady of the Palace). Their last film together before their divorce, was Nahr al-Hob (nhr lHb, The River of Love) in 1960. ===Controversy in the late 1960s=== Al Haram (1965). Hamama left Egypt from 1966 to 1971, claiming that she was being harassed by Egyptian Intelligence. She had been a supporter of the 1952 Revolution, but later became an opponent of the Free Officers and their oppressive regime. She said they were "asking her to cooperate" but she apologized and refused. In consequence, she was forbidden to travel or participate in film festivals. She was only able to leave Egypt after many serious disputes, where she lived in Paris, London and Lebanon. While she was away, then President Gamal Abdel Nasser asked famous writers, journalists and friends to try to convince her to return to Egypt. He called her a "national treasure" and even awarded her an honorary decoration in 1965. However, she did not return until 1971, after Nasser's death. Following her return she played roles conveying messages of democracy. She often criticized the laws in Egypt in her films. In the 1972 film Imbratoriyat Meem (mbrTwry@ mym, The Empire of M), Hamama presented a pro-democratic point of view and received an award from the Soviet Union of Women in the Moscow International Festival. Her most significant film was Oridu Hallan ('ryd Hlan, I Want a Solution). In this film, she criticised laws governing marriage and divorce in Egypt. After the film, the Egyptian government abrogated a law that forbade wives from divorcing their husbands, therefore allowing khul'. ===Late career=== As Hamama aged, her acting roles declined and she made fewer films compared to earlier in her career, but nevertheless her films were successful. She made her first television appearances in her late career. She starred in the TV mini-series Dameer Ablah Hikmat (Dmyr 'bl@ Hkmt, Mrs. Hikmat's Conscience). After 1993, her career stalled. It was not until 2000 that she returned in the successful TV mini-series Wajh iial-Qamar which was broadcast on 23 TV channels in the Middle East. In this mini-series, Hamama portrayed and criticized many problems in Egyptian and Middle Eastern society. Despite some criticisms, the mini-series received much praise and acclaim. Hamama was awarded the Egyptian Best TV Actor of the Year and the mini-series won the Best TV Series Award in the Egyptian Radio and Television Festival. She entered history as the highest-paid actress in an Egyptian television miniseries until 2006, when another actress was paid more. Hamama, with Rushdy Abaza, in I Want a Solution (1974). Before the 1950s, Hamama had leading roles in 30 films, in which she often played the role of a weak, empathetic, poor girl. After the 1950s, Hamama was in search of her real identity and was trying to establish herself as a distinct figure. During this period, her choice of material and roles was somewhat limited. However, film producers soon capitalised on her popularity with audiences in local and Middle Eastern markets. She began to play realistic, strong women, such as in Sira' Fi Al- Wadi (Sr` fy lwdy, Struggle in the Valley, 1954) where she portrayed a rich man's daughter who, contrary to stereotype, was a realistic woman who helped and supported the poor. In the 1952 film Miss Fatmah (l'stdh@ fTm@), Hamama starred as a law student who believed women were as important as men in society. In Imbratoriyat Meem (mbrTwry@ mym, The Empire of M), she played the role of a widow who takes care of her large family and suffers hardship. Her most influential film was Oridu Hallan ('ryd Hl, I Want a Solution) which criticized the laws of marriage and divorce in Egypt. A law in Egypt that forbade Khul' (khl`) - a divorce initiated by the wife - was annulled immediately afterwards. Most critics agree that Hamama's most challenging role was in the 1959 film Doaa al-Karawan (d` lkrwn, The Nightingale's Prayer), which is considered to be one of the best Egyptian films. It is based on the novel of the same name by the prominent Egyptian writer Taha Hussein. In this film, Hamama played the role of Amnah, a young woman who seeks revenge from her uncle for the honour killing of her sister. After this film, Hamama carefully picked her roles. In 1960, she starred in the film Nahr Hob (nhr lHb, The River of Love) which was based on Leo Tolstoy's well known novel Anna Karenina and in 1961, she played the lead role in the film La Tutf'e al- Shams (l tTfy' lshms, Don't Turn Off the Sun) based on the novel by Ihsan Abdel Quddous. ==Death and funeral== Faten Hamama died on 17 January 2015, aged 83. Her son Tarek Sharif did not state the cause of her death. Tributes soon poured in from across the film industry following her death, as well as from government figures. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who was on a visit abroad, mourned her death and sent an envoy to her funeral, while a statement from his office described her as a person of "high creative value." "She will remain a symbol of the genuine Egyptian art and commitment to its ethics," the statement added. The Ministry of Culture ordered a two-day period of mourning and a halt in all artistic activity. Secretary-General of the Arab League, Nabil el-Arabi, called her a "symbol of refined Egyptian and Arab art". The country's dailies gave her prominence in their front pages, with newspaper Al-Akhbar displaying "Farewell to the Lady of the Arabic Screen" as a headline. The funeral was attended by thousands of mourners who blocked traffic around the mosque where the ceremony was being held. The event was broadcast live on a private channel. Attendees included Minister of Culture Gaber Asfour, former presidential candidate Amr Moussa, as well as several actors and actresses, but not Omar Sharif (who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, dying at the same age less than six months later). King Mohammed VI of Morocco assigned his country's ambassador in Cairo to attend the funeral. ==Personal life== While filming Abu Zayd al-Hilali ('bw zyd lhll~) in 1947, she and director Ezzel Dine Zulficar fell in love and wed. The marriage lasted for seven years. They divorced in 1954. Hamama has said that her love for Zulficar was little more than a student's admiration and love for a teacher. The two remained friends, and Hamama continued to star in his films after the divorce. They had one child, a daughter, Nadia Zulficar. In 1954, Hamama chose Omar Sharif to co-star with her in a film. In this film, she uncharacteristically agreed to a romantic scene involving a kiss. During the filming, they fell in love. Sharif converted to Islam and married her. The couple co-starred in many films. However, after nearly two decades together, the couple divorced in 1974; they had one son, Tarek Sharif. The couple also have 2 grandsons from Tarek, Omar Sharif Jr. and Karem Sharif. Omar Sharif Jr. followed his grandfathers road to fame and now acts in the U.S. in small roles and is a high LGBTQ activist. Hamama later married Mohamed Abdel Wahab Mahmoud, an Egyptian doctor. They resided in Cairo until her death on 17 January 2015 following a short illness.Notice of death of Faten Hamama, alarabiya.net; accessed 18 January 2014.

She received her first award in 1951 for her role in I'm the Past, which was presented to her by different venues, including the Egyptian Catholic Center for Cinema. The country's Ministry of Guidance also awarded her the title of Best Actress in both 1955 and 1961. These were followed by many different awards for best actress from various national and international events.

The University President Peter Dorman introduced the Egyptian actress as an "icon, legend, and luminary." However, "I feel a great happiness, today, greater than any gift that I have ever received. Currently, there is a massive attack on art, culture and anything related to literature. So this honorary doctorate will not only make me happy, but will bring happiness to all the artists and cultured people in Egypt and the Arab world." said Hamama, after receiving her doctorate from Beirut, Lebanon. *A Google Doodle on 27 May 2016 commemorated Hamama's 85th birth anniversary. ==Selected filmography== ===Film=== {| class="wikitable" style="width: 60%;" |- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" !Year !International title !Arabic title !Role |- |1939 |Happy Day |Yawm Said, ywm s`yd |Aneesa |- |1944 |Bullet in the Heart |Rossassa Fel Qalb, rSS@ fy lqlb |Najwah |- |1946 |Angel of Mercy |Malak al-Rahma, mlk lrHm@ |Thoraya |- |1947 |Abu Zayd al-Hilali |Abu Zayd al-Hilali, 'bw zyd lhlly |Caliph's daughter |- |rowspan="4"|1948 |The Small Millionaire |Al-Millionairah al- Saghirah, lmlywnyr@ lSGyr@ |Pilot's girlfriend |- |Immortality |Khulood, khlwd |Laila / Amal |- |The Two Orphans |Al-Yateematain, lytymtyn |Ne'mat |- |Towards Glory |Nahwa al-Majd, nHw lmjd |Suhair |- |rowspan="3"|1949 |Chair of Confession |Kursi al-I'tiraf, krsy l`trf |Phileberta |- |Lady of the House |Sitt al-Bayt, st lbyt |Elham |- |Every House Has a Man |Kul Bayt Lahu Rajel, klW byt lh rjl |Faten |- |rowspan="3"|1951 |Son of the Nile |Ibn al- Nile, bn lnyl |Zebaida |- |Your Day Will Come |Lak Yawm Ya Zalem, lk ywm y Zlm |Ne'mat |- |I'm The Past |Ana al-Madi, 'n lmDy |Elham's daughter |- |rowspan="3"|1952 |House Number 13 |Al-Manzel Raqam 13, lmnzl rqm 13 |Nadia |- |Immortal Song |Lahn al-Kholood, lHn lkhlwd |Wafa' |- |Miss Fatimah |Al- Ustazah Fatimah, l'stdh@ fTm@ |Fatimah |- |rowspan="2"|1953 |A'isha |A'isha, `y'sh@ |A'isha |- |Date with Life |Maw'ed Ma' al-Hayat, mw`d m` lHy@ |Amal |- |rowspan="6"|1954 |Pity My Tears |Irham Dmoo'i, rHm dmw`y |Amal |- |Traces in the Sand |Athar Fi al-Rimal, 'thr fy lrml |Ragia |- |The Unjust Angel |Al- Malak al-Zalem, lmlk lZlm |Nadia |- |Always with You |Dayman Ma'ak, dy'm m`k |Tefeeda |- |Date with Happiness |Maw'ed Ma' al-Sa'adah, mw`d m` ls`d@ |Ehsan / Amal |- |Struggle in the Valley |Sira' Fi al-Wadi, Sr` fy lwdy |Amal |- |rowspan="2"|1955 |Our Beautiful Days |Ayyamna al-Holwa, 'ymn lHlw@ |Hoda |- |Love and Tears |Hob Wa Dumoo', Hb w dmw` |Fatimah |- |rowspan="2"|1956 |Love Date |Maw'ed Gharam, mw`d Grm |Nawal |- |Struggle in the Pier |Sira' Fi al-Mina, Sr` fy lmyn |Hameedah |- |rowspan="3"|1957 |Road of Hope |Tareeq al-Amal, Tryq l'ml |Faten |- |Land of Peace |Ard al- Salam, 'rD lslm |Salma |- |Sleepless |La Anam, l 'nm |Nadia Lotfy |- |rowspan="3"|1958 |The Barred Road |Al-Tareeq al-Masdood, lTryq lmsdwd |Fayza |- |The Virgin Wife |Al-Zawjah al-Azra', lzwj@ l`dhr |Mona |- |Lady of the Castle |Sayyidat al-Qasr, syd@ lqSr |Sawsan |- |rowspan="2"|1959 |Among the Ruins |Bayn al-Atlal, byn l'Tll |Mona |- |The Nightingale's Prayer |Doaa al-Karawan, d` lkrwn |Amnah |- |1960 |River of Love |Nahr al- Hob, nhr lHb |Nawal |- |rowspan="2"|1961 |I Will Not Confess |Lan A'tref, ln '`trf |Amal |- |Don't Set the Sun Off |La Tutf'e al-Shams, l tTfy' lshms |Layla |- |1962 |The Miracle |Al-Mu'jiza, lm`jz@ |Layla |- |rowspan="4"|1963 |Cairo (USA) |Cairo |Amina |- |No Time For Love |La Waqt Lil Hob, l wqt llHub |Fawziyah |- |The Open Door |Al-Bab al-Maftooh, lbb lmftwH |Laila |- |The Last Night |Al-Laylah al-Akheera, llyl@ l'khyr@ |Nadia / Fawziyah |- |rowspan="3"|1965 |The Sin |Al-Haram, lHrm |Azizah |- |Story of a Lifetime |Hikayet al-'Omr Kolloh, Hky@ l`mr klWh |Nadia |- |The Confession |Al-'Itriaf, l`trf |Nawal |- |1966 |Something in My Life |Shai' Fi Hayati, shy fy Hyty |A'ida |- |1970 |The Great Love |Al-Hob al-Kabeer, lHb lkbyr |Hanan |- |1971 |The Thin Thread |Al-Khayt al-Rfee, lkhyT lrfy` |Mona |- |1972 |M Empire |Imbratoriyat Meem, mbrTwry@ mym |Mona |- |rowspan="2"|1974 |My Love |Habibati, Hbybty |Samia |- |I Need a Solution |Oridu Hallan, 'rydu Hlan |Fawziyah |- |1977 |Mouths and Rabbits |Afwah wa Araneb, 'fwh w 'rnb |Ne'mat |- |1979 |No Condolences for Ladies |Wa La 'Aza'a Lil Sayyidat, wl `z llsydt |Rawya |- |1985 |The Night of Fatima's Arrest |Laylat al-Qabd 'Ala Fatimah, lyl@ lqbD `l~ fTm@ |Fatimah |- |1988 |Sweet Days..
