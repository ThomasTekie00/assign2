It was named after the heir of the Hungarian throne, Emperor Joseph II in 1777. ==Description== Jozsefvaros mostly consists of old, often neglected residential buildings with nice interiors. It can be divided into three parts, the borders being Grand Boulevard (Nagykorut) and the roads Fiumei ut and Orczy ut. The innermost, central part includes several remarkable spots, such as the National Museum, and the central buildings of the Eotvos Lorand University, the Semmelweis University, the Academy of Drama and Film, and the Metropolitan Ervin Szabo Library, complemented by the Kempelen Farkas Student Information and Resource Centre. The Piarist Secondary School, the main building of the Karoli Gaspar University of the Reformed Church, and the Law Faculty of the Pazmany Peter Catholic University are also situated here, as well as the Hungarian Radio. This part is called "Palace Quarter", out of which one can still see Wenckheim Palace, hosting the Metropolitan Library, and Palffy Palace with the Classical Music Collection of the above. This neighborhood underwent major renovations between 1996 and 2002 and it has become a happy, swarming place with scores of students and several cafes and pizzerias. Jozsefvaros railway station The second part, beyond Nagykorut (about farther) has a worse reputation, due to the prostitution that was rampant in the 1990s (and earlier), which has been mostly eliminated through cameras throughout the district. In this part one can find the Centre for Foreign Languages (the oldest and "authentic" language examination place in Hungary), Erkel Theatre (a department of the Hungarian State Opera House), the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Corvin Budapest Film Palace (a multiplex cinema), one of Budapest's biggest gardens (Orczy-kert), and a large complex of cliniques. Its traditional craftsmen neighbourhood, which became a slum in the previous decades, is currently under re-development. The dilapidated 19th century housing stock is cleared to make way for large office blocks and housing developments. Corvin-Szigony Project is the biggest urban renewal project in Central-Europe.http://www.corvinsetany.hu/koncepcio.php?lang=en The effects and methods of the project were criticized, mainly for the destruction of the architectural heritage of the area.
