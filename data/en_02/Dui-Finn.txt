Dui Finn, son of Setna Innarraid, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He took power after killing his predecessor, and his father's killer, Siomon Brecc. He ruled for ten years, before he was killed by Siomon's son Muiredach Bolgrach. The Lebor Gabala Erenn synchronises his reign with those of Xerxes I (485-465 BC) and Artaxerxes I (465-424 BC) of Persia.R. A.
